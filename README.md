# MCQ_Shell_Scripting
Developed a script for Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), presenting questions one by one with four options. Users select an option, and if the answer is correct, they earn 1+ mark. Incorrect answers and missing responses are tracked separately. After answering all questions, the script displays the results showing the count of correct, incorrect, and missing answers.
Execute the script using the following commands. Ensure the script file is present by cloning the repository:
1. git clone repository_url.
2. go to the directory (cd repo_name)
3. ./mcq_Question.sh

The script will run, presenting questions sequentially with options. This example demonstrates how to create a shell script for a similar purpose.
